        <h1 class="h">ABOUT OUR PROJECT</h1>
        <p class="p">The main objective of this project is to help the student to select the colleges for counselling after completing their 12th std. Due to covid, counselling process through online becomes very difficult for some students. Even me and my friends faced this issue. After getting to know that this problem is faced by most of the people, so we took this problem to provide solution.Most of the students from rural areas mostly rely on websites and social media for knowing about the colleges which sometimes may have wrong information or sometimes may mislead them to choose the college wrongly.
            <br><br>      To overcome the problem in choosing colleges this website will help the students to choose the right college according to the studentâ€™s ranks and their choice. Student enters his rank and what community he belongs to. According to his rank, after analyzing the ranks and availability of seats with the data of 5-10 years, the   predicted colleges list will be shown. From the list the student can  select a particular college along with the details of the college. Then he/she can have a clear idea of which college he/she can choose in counselling according to his/her cutoff.
